// Worksheet 2.5

/* 
 * Task 1.3 - Practice
 * Write a program that generate two random numbers between 1 and 6 with a constraint
 * that the sum of these two numbers cannot be 7. If the sum is 7,
 * regenerate two new random numbers. Use a do..while loop for this task.
 * The loop should terminate when a sum other than 7 is achieved and print the
 * two numbers. You should use srand() and rand().
